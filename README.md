# The Greedy Bastards List
The Greedy Bastards List is a versatile and consumer focused app in which users can create their own gift registries, and view and purchase items on other users registries. 
## Motivation
The motivation behind the GBL was to have a single registry app for users as opposed to multiple registries and logins across multiple e-commerce platforms.
